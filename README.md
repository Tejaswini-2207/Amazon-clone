# Amazon-clone
The Amazon Clone Project aims to replicate the front-end design of the Amazon e-commerce website using only HTML and CSS. The project focuses on mimicking the look and feel of Amazon's user interface, including its header, navigation bar, product listing, product detail pages, and footer.
